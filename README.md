# Analysis of Oceanographic/Atmospheric Data

**Overview**: Oceanographic/atmospheric observations and model output typically produce large,
multivariate data sets with signals of interest embedded in some form of random variability. To infer
useful information requires skills in statistics and computational methods. We will work together to
develop these skills by examining various physical phenomena using in situ and satellite observations,
with Python as our analysis platform

**Topic Areas**: The course will be divided into four modules:
1. Time series variability
2. Establic relationship in multiple time series
3. describe spatio-temporal patterns
4. examine oscillatory signals
